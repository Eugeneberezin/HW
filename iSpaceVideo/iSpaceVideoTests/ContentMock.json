The full moon was the third in a series of “supermoons,” when the Moon is closer to Earth in its orbit -- known as perigee -- and about 14 percent brighter than usual. It was also the second full moon of the month, commonly known as a “blue moon.” As the super blue moon passed through Earth’s shadow, viewers in some locations experienced a total lunar eclipse. While in Earth’s shadow, the moon also took on a reddish tint – which is sometimes referred to as a “blood moon.”",

After launching on June 18, 2009 and entering lunar orbit on June 23rd, the spacecraft continues to collect vast amounts of data vital to our understanding of the lunar landscape and environment, our solar system, and to our future exploration goals for the Moon and Mars. This video highlights some notable facts and accomplishments of the LRO mission over the past decade, all of which are paving the way forward for reestablishing a human presence on the Moon with the newly-announced Artemis program.",

Its survey will help pave the way for a new era of human missions to the lunar surface and will bring us a step closer to developing a sustainable, long-term robotic and human presence on the Moon as part of the Artemis program.",

While previous lunar missions have detected hints of water on the Moon, new data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) pinpoints areas near the south pole where water is likely to exist. The key to this discovery is hydrogen, the main ingredient in water: LRO uses its Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector, or LEND, to measure how much hydrogen is trapped within the lunar soil. By combining years of LEND data, scientists see mounting evidence of hydrogen-rich areas near the Moon’s south pole, strongly suggesting the presence of frozen water.",

This video tutorial explains what happens during a total solar eclipse and a partial eclipse and how often they both occur. The video also explains how a solar eclipse differs from a lunar eclipse, and gives a helpful tip on how to remember the difference. In addition, the video examines how the two parts of the moon’s shadow, the umbra and penumbra, affect how we see an eclipse on the Earth, and illustrates the surprising true shape of the umbra. The video concludes by highlighting how data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has helped us better map a solar eclipse’s path of totality. Visualizations included in this piece showcase the August 21, 2017 total solar eclipse happening in the United States.",

The Apollo 8 mission proved the performance of the command and service module. This historic mission launched on December 21, 1968 to demonstrate a lunar trajectory and was the first crewed launch of the Saturn V rocket. On Christmas Eve, Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders were the first humans to orbit the Moon and the first to see an Earthrise above its surface.",

The three companies selected are:  ·        Blue Origin of Kent, Washington ·        Dynetics of Huntsville, Alabama ·        SpaceX of Hawthorne, California  This exciting final step in our acquisition process puts all the pieces in play needed to explore the Moon quickly and sustainably. Working more efficiently with our commercial partners than ever before on this procurement process, I am confident the team we have assembled contains all the expertise, skill and commitment needed to accomplish our Artemis missions.  While these awards today represent herculean efforts by many to get to this point, there is more work yet to be done. I look forward to closely following the development of the three HLS designs in the coming months, one of which will take our intrepid astronauts to the surface of the Moon for the first time since 1972.",

The number of asteroid impacts to the Moon and Earth increased by two to three times starting around 290 million years ago, researchers reported in a January 18 paper in the journal Science.  They could tell by creating the first comprehensive timeline of large craters on the Moon formed in the last billion years by using images and thermal data collected by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). When the scientists compared those to the timeline of Earth’s craters, they found the two bodies had recorded the same history of asteroid bombardment—one that contradicts theories about Earth’s impact rate."

However, there are some parts of the Moon that never see sunlight. These areas are called permanently shadowed regions, and they appear dark because unlike on the Earth, the axis of the Moon is nearly perpendicular to the direction of the sun's light. The result is that the bottoms of certain craters are never pointed toward the Sun, with some remaining dark for over two billion years. However, thanks to new data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, we can now see into these dark craters in incredible detail.",

When a speck of comet debris strikes the Moon it vaporizes on impact, creating a shock wave in the lunar soil. For a sufficiently large impactor, this shock wave can breach the soil’s dry upper layer and release water molecules from a hydrated layer below. The LADEE spacecraft detects these water molecules as they enter the tenuous lunar atmosphere, with peaks in the water signal correlating to known meteor showers on Earth. The discovery of water just beneath the Moon’s surface provides a potential resource for future exploration, and it improves our understanding the Moon’s geologic past and its continued evolution."

Eclipses happen about every six months, but this one is special. For the first time in almost 40 years, the path of the Moon's shadow passes through the continental United States.  The video features several visualizations of this event. From behind the Earth, we see the night sides of both the Earth and Moon and the umbral and penumbral shadow cones projecting from the Moon. We then see the tilted orbit of the Moon and the long, thin shadow cones striking the Earth. In the view from behind the Moon, we see the daylit far side of the Moon and the western hemisphere of the Earth, and from this vantage point, the outline of the shadow on the Earth is circular.  Most of the video shows a close-up view of the U.S. during the eclipse. Everyone there will see the Moon at least partially block the Sun, but those along the path of totality, shown in red, will see the Moon block the Sun entirely. The appearance of the Sun throughout the eclipse is shown for a number of locations in North America, with each Sun image oriented to the local horizon.  Some of the visualizations use extremely long telephoto lenses to visually compress the scene, but all of them are geometrically accurate and true to scale."

Our closest celestial neighbor is always a wondrous sight, but on the morning of Jan. 31, 2018, three special lunar events are all happening at the same time, providing an excellent excuse to go out and enjoy the nighttime sky. 1 - The full Moon is near the closest point of its orbit so it appears a little larger than usual, what many call a Supermoon. 2 - It’s the second full Moon of the month, what many call a Blue Moon, though the Moon is not literally blue. 3 - There’s a total lunar eclipse, what many call a Blood Moon, visible before sunrise for the western half of the U.S. and other countries near the Pacific. During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon crosses through the shadow of the Earth and LITERALLY appears red as it reflects all of Earth’s sunrises and sunsets. Join NASA scientists Michelle Thaller and Noah Petro live from the Goddard Space Flight Center as we discuss where, when, and how to view this lunar extravaganza and the latest Moon science brought to us by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.",

The researchers are looking for signs of life endemic to the Moon, as well as organic compounds that are the basic building blocks of life. Of course, no lunar life was found in these samples, and we now know that the Moon does not harbor life.

About the size of a golf cart, the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, will roam several miles, using its four science instruments — including a 1-meter drill — to sample various soil environments. Planned for delivery as early as December 2022, VIPER will collect about 100 days of data that will be used to inform development of the first global water resource maps of the Moon.   For the first time ever, VIPER will actually sample the water ice at the Moon's South Pole, where the first woman and next man will land in 2024 under NASA's Artemis program."

As a geologist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Brent specializes in planetary volcanology, where he investigates volcanic activity throughout the solar system. His work demonstrates how geology is an exciting science that helps us to understand some of the most common and fundamental forces affecting planets and moons in the universe."
